vishal.motwani@uipath.com,Issue for my loan,"Hi, my name Rebecca Evans and my issue is regarding a loan of $51000 from Santander Bank. This company is abusing people. 
I took a loan for $51000 from Santander Bank and I paid the dealer $5000 down payment on 2017-01-04 for a Ford Mustang. I paid 5 years 6 months $600 and stopped paying on 2020-05-11 because the remaining balance in the loan for the car after I paid $41000 was $1000. If I don’t surrender the car to them, they will reportedly repossess it. 
This loan is still on my credit report after 7 years it's supposed to be deleted after 7 years. Loan started 2017-01-04 and end 2020-06-15. Please help fix this .."

vishal.motwani@uipath.com,horrible service,"Dear Sir/Madam, I have been running my 3 businesses over 25 years and have delt with hundreds of banks. I must say no bank as a worse service than this one. I have written over 6 times to you to look into solving the simple isssue to add a payee and despite of my emails. The website is crap that does not support this simple feature in first place. I did like this sorted out asap. "
vishal.motwani@uipath.com,IRA issue,"Dear Sir/Madam, 
I have been a customer of this bank since 1995 and have always maintained a healthy balance and paid all dues on time. As you know a major aspect of my holdings is in IRA account. I am 1 year away from leagally accessing that money without penalties. In the mean time, I wish to embark on an home improvement project. Could you tell me what loan amount and loan terms I can apply for ?"
vishal.motwani@uipath.com,multiple loans,"Hi, I currently have 4 separate student loans that I have been paying on for years with Citi Bank, Wells Fargo Bank, Schwab Financial and American Education Services. They are both federal and private, I am drowning in student loan debt, when I graduated 4 years ago with my degree in Biology I owed approximately $160000.00 in student loan debt, I have been paying approximately $1000.00 a month since 2019-07-06 and my payments just went up again, meanwhile I still owe $160000.00 in student loans, my balance does not appear to be going down but actually going up.
I have other monthly expenses such car, utilities etc that I am now having a hard time paying, I had to file a chapter with IRS back in 2020-04-14, I work full time as a Bio Chemist and make a decent salary but these student loans are killing me and I can't get ahead, I was divorced recently so my filing status changed to single, I am on an income driven repayment plan with Schwab and when I submitted my renewal application with my new single filing status my payment went from $270.00 a month to now $370.00 a month. 
My payment with American Education Services just increased from $470.00 a month to $490.00 a month due to interest rate increase. I have tried desperately to get these amounts lowered, but all 4 companies said there is nothing more they can do, I am ineligible for forbearance or deferment as I have exhausted all of that.
 IRS said my loan would be forgiven in 25 years. In 25 years, I will be 50 years old, these lenders only look at your income, they don't factor in your other monthly expenses, and they don't seem to care, even with a chapter with IRS. "
vishal.motwani@uipath.com,Craiglist,"Hi, I am John Stewart and I sold an item on Craigslist which was a digital code for a game I had to send the code through Discord messaging. 
I received a message saying the person did not make the purchase I thought they were just having second thoughts because I did not deliver the code right away So I double checked by sending them a message to see if they still wanted the code or they wanted a refund and they said they wanted the code. So I sent the code and then after I sent the code they say their account is hacked and do not communicate with their account So I call XXXX and explain the whole situation and they end up releasing the money on PayPal to me So a couple of weeks go by and then I get an email from PayPal saying there was a dispute and so I call PayPal about the dispute and I explain what happened and they tell me to appeal the dispute and I did what they said I get the results of the appeal and I somehow loss and the reason was I have no protection for intangible items but under Paypal's buyer protection the buyer had no protection to make a complaint on Craigslist so the buyer went around Craigslist and did it through their bank So I called Paypal the day I got the results and asked why I lost and I explained again what happened and he said he would allow me to appeal again So I called XXXX to let them know what was going on and they said let 's do a 3-way call with Paypal and then when we call PayPal the agent tells me I am not getting an appeal and I will not be getting credited back the $600 they charged me which is split up by $400 for the item and $200 for a chargeback fee So the buyer went around Craigslist by going to their bank and I am having to pay for the buyer 's mistake."

vishal.motwani@uipath.com,Multiple transaction issue,"Im a regular customer of Western Union Financial. On 2018-08-08 I sent two separate transactions overseas. The reasons I did two transactions was the auto fill from previous transactions. 
I sent $70.00 and then $30.00 to the same person. However, Western Union Financial cancelled the transaction for the $70.00 and the $30.00 available.
I wasnt notified by Western Union that they canceled the transaction. I didnt know whats going until the receiver went to Western Union 08/13/2018 after going for consecutive days. Western Union overseas told I took the money back. On 2018-08-08 I called Western Union and was told by two different representatives that they cant access the transfer, but I should call back in 15-20 minutes two times. Finally, I was told that they canceled my transaction because I sent separate transactions. Nobody seems to know whats the real problem. I had to asked for a refund. 
After numerous calls I called back 2018-08-20 and asked for the department that placed restrictions on my transactions and was give this email contact@westernunion.com for help. I sent an email and I havent received an email or phone call from Western Union about this inconvenience. I must say this situation was handled unprofessional and without regards or thoughtfulness of all party involved. Im very disappointed with Western Union."
